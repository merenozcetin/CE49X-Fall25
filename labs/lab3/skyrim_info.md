# Skyrim Repository Information

## What is Skyrim?

Skyrim (https://github.com/secondlaw-ai/skyrim) is a unified interface for running state-of-the-art large weather models such as Graphcast, Pangu, and Fourcastnet. This open-source project provides access to initial conditions from sources like NOAA GFS and ECMWF IFS, allowing users to generate weather forecasts for different time horizons with minimal setup requirements.

## How it could be useful for weather data analysis:

Skyrim democratizes access to advanced weather forecasting capabilities that were previously only available on supercomputers, making it possible to run complex weather models on consumer-grade hardware. For civil and environmental engineering projects, this tool can be invaluable for planning, risk assessment, and resource management by providing accurate weather predictions for infrastructure projects, flood risk analysis, renewable energy planning, and construction scheduling.
